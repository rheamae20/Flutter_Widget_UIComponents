# Flutter_Widget_UIComponents

The topic assigned to me is Flutter Tabs from the Flutter_Widget_UIComponents collection.
Tabs are used in Flutter to organize content into multiple sections. They allow users to switch between different screens or views without leaving the page, giving a smoother and cleaner navigation experience.

 Key Concept

The main feature of Flutter Tabs is that they combine TabBar and TabBarView inside a DefaultTabController.
TabBar shows the clickable tabs at the top.
TabBarView holds the content for each tab.
From the resource, I understood that Tabs are very useful for apps that require categorized navigation, like separating Home, Profile, and Settings into different pages.

ðŸ”¹ Wrap Up

To summarize, Flutter Tabs are important for building apps that require organized navigation and easy switching between pages.
While working on this, I learned how Tabs connect multiple widgets together to create smooth navigation, and how easy it is to manage multiple views in Flutter.

In my modified code, I customized the Tab design and content.
For example, I added icons with text in the TabBar and adjusted the background color to improve the UI.
These changes made the Tabs more visually appealing and easier for users to navigate.
